# Analysis_of_Tracking_Systems

This repository contains implmentation of common tracking algorithms.
Each folder contains the homonymous algorithm with its implementation in MATLAB and a report. 

> Kalman Filter implmentation deal with 1D and 2D velocity tracking system whose state transitions and state update equations are derived from given problem statement.

> Extended Kalman Filter deals with a non-linear system.

> Particle Filter deal with a system consisting of a 1D position, moving on a line. The system follows a motion pattern where the position `zig-zags' back and forth on a line. The sensor on the system detects a eld strength that is
the sum of the distances from two xed-position magnets.
